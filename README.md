# **Crime Analysis with Tableau**

With how fast the world is evolving, we need innovative ways to sort the data and provide rapid solutions to problems.
One of the ways is crime analysis which  helps law enforcement agencies understand patterns and trends in criminal activity, allowing them to allocate resources more effectively.

### We can achieve through different types of analysis
#### However we limit it to two analysis for this project

<br>**Time Period Analysis**</br>
Analysing crime data over different time periods is essential for several reasons. It helps identify temporal patterns and trends in criminal activity, allowing law enforcement and communities to tailor their responses accordingly.

<br>**Comparative Analysis**</br>
Comparative analysis is essential for gaining a broader perspective on crime data, enabling more informed decision-making, resource allocation, policy development, and provide preventative solutions.

### Lastly
<br>**Dashboard**</br>
A very important tool needed to display all the collected details in much simplier and visualized way.
